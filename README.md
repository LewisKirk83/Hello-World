# Hello-World
New to github and new to coding in general. Starting to learn Python through various sounds exes and excited about moving forward!!

There is so much support and guidance on YouTube and websites to help with learning programming, as the future seems to be centred around
These fields, I thought I would get started and then show my son some things when he gets a bit older. 

Really enjoying learning the Python language and performing so commands.
